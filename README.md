# IVBP_Solving-Unity
Initial boundary value problem solving for a 2D wave equation in Unity
Script.cs is the file that you really want to go through
^ file talks about solving the 2D wave equation for intial boundary value problem
The code is in C#, github shows otherwise due to othercode of unity being present
